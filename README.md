# Learn Svelte

My personal Svelte learning progress with Tailwind CSS.

## How to build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Build CSS

```bash
npm run css
```

## How to run

:warning: Run build script above first!

```bash
npm run preview
```

## How to develop

```bash
npm run dev
```

:warning: Warning. Don't minify your css, it will eliminate some custom styles in `src/css/input.css`
